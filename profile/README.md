## About MiruS

**MiruS** is an independent research and engineering organization focused on building
clear, scalable, and future-oriented software systems.

We work at the intersection of **applied development** and **technical research** —
from mobile applications and web platforms to infrastructure and algorithmic foundations.

MiruS is not a studio and not a startup by definition.  
It is a **long-term engineering initiative**.
